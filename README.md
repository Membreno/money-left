# Money Left Project
This application was created to help users manage the money they have left and was designed to give users the ability to track how much money they spend / receive as well as track their reoccuring bills.
Bringing the act of balancing a checkbook into the 21st century this is a solution that will help users stay up to date with all their financial needs without needing a connection to their bank account.
